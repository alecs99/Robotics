# **Laboratory Homework for the Introduction to Robotics Courses @ University of Bucharest (Unibuc Robotics)**
## **1st Homework**
**3PotentiometersRGB**: Simple Arduino code controlling an RGB led controlled using 3 potentiometers (using 1 for every color). <br />

## **2nd Homework**
**KnockDetector**: Simple Arduino code to detect motion. In this project I used two buzzers (1 active and 1 passive) and a pushbutton. The passive buzzer detects motion and the active one starts a sound. In order to stop that sound the pushbutton must be pressed.

## **3rd Homework**
**4x7 Segment Controlled with a joystick**: Simple Arduino code controlling 4x7 segment display to change values between them. Using the joystick using the X-axis it moves between segments (it is marked the position by Decimal Point). When a segment is being selected by pressing the joystick button the decimal point turn off and then you can change the digit between Y-axis. Then you can select the value of the digit. You can cycle between again.

## **4th Homework**
**LCD Menu Controlled with a joystick**: Simple Lcd Menu controlled with a joystick. In the menu section you can scroll between options using Y-axis (the selection is marked with '>'). To select an option press the joystick button. <br>
  **1.Play**: The play screen is showing the lives, level and score. After 5 seconds the level and score raise (1 level and score = level*3). After 10 seconds game ends, it will pop-up a message. To go back on main menu press joystick button again.<br>
  **2.Highscore**: The Highscore screen shows the highest score achieved and player's name. To go back on main menu press joystick button again.<br>
  **3.Settings**: In the settings you can change the starting level by using the X-axis. To go back on main menu press joystick button again.<br>

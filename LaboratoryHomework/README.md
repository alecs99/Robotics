# **Laboratory Homework for the Introduction to Robotics Courses @ University of Bucharest (Unibuc Robotics)**
## **1st Homework**
**3PotentiometersRGB**: Simple Arduino code controlling an RGB led controlled using 3 potentiometers (using 1 for every color). <br />

## **2nd Homework**
**KnockDetector**: Simple Arduino code to detect motion. In this project I used two buzzers (1 active and 1 passive) and a pushbutton. The passive buzzer detects motion and the active one starts a sound. In order to stop that sound the pushbutton must be pressed.

## **3rd Homework**
**4x7 Segment Controlled with a joystick**: Simple Arduino code controlling 4x7 segment display to change values between them.

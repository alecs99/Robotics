# **Pong Game**
## **Description**<br>
Pong is a 2 player game similar to table tennis which features two paddles and a ball. You also have a number of lives (depends of the level you play). The game ends when one of a player loses all of his lives. The winner is the player which has the highest score. Note: The player who has lives and the end of the game will receive a bonus (depending on the level you play). You get a point if the ball reached opponent's side without him touching it with his paddle. When a point is being scored the LED will light up.
